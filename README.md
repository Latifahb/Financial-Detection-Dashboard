## Problem Statement

This dataset presents a synthetic representation of mobile money transactions, meticulously crafted to mirror the complexities of real-world financial activities while integrating fraudulent behaviours for research purposes. Derived from a simulator named Pay Sim, which utilizes aggregated data from actual financial logs of a mobile money service in an African country, this dataset aims to fill the gap in publicly available financial datasets for fraud detection studies. It encompasses a variety of transaction types including CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, and TRANSFER over a simulated period of 30 days, providing a comprehensive environment for evaluating fraud detection methodologies. By addressing the intrinsic privacy concerns associated with financial transactions, this dataset is scaled to 1/4 of the original dataset size for efficient use within the Kaggle platform.
