## Problem Statement

This dataset is a synthetic representation of mobile money transactions, meticulously crafted to reflect the complexities of real-world financial activities while incorporating fraudulent behaviours for research purposes. It is derived from a simulator named PaySim, which utilises aggregated data from actual financial logs of a mobile money service in an African country. The dataset aims to fill the gap in publicly available financial datasets for fraud detection studies. It encompasses various transaction types, including CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, and TRANSFER, over a simulated period of 30 days. This provides a comprehensive environment for evaluating fraud detection methodologies. Addressing privacy concerns associated with financial transactions, the dataset is scaled to a quarter of the original size for efficient use on the Kaggle platform.

### Recommendations:    

Although this is a synthetic representation of mobile money transactions, organisations worldwide need to strengthen their processes for handling fraudulent transactions to ensure that:

  - Customers are safe and protected from fraudulent activities.
  - Compliance processes are upheld to high standards during money transfers.
  - Banks address intrinsic privacy concerns associated with financial transactions.
    
While fraud may be inevitable, every financial organisation has a duty of care to its customers to ensure robust measures are in place to protect them from recurrent fraud.
